# Datatypes
A datatype extension for Ludum Roblox visual coding using Blockly.

This is to add datatypes from https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes into ludum. Note that this isnt every datatype just the ones that we found most important. If there is one you need or will want feel free to add it and create a pull request ðŸ˜€
